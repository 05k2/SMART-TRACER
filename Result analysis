In the future, the digital contact tracing algorithm can be further improved by integrating advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to not only identify potential contacts but also predict disease transmission hotspots, optimize resource allocation, and provide real-time recommendations for public health interventions. This holistic approach, combined with enhanced privacy-preserving technologies, will empower the system to offer proactive and data-driven insights, ultimately strengthening our ability to contain infectious diseases while safeguarding individual privacy and civil liberties.
